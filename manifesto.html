      <h1>Democracy and communalism</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Democracy is a system where the power to decide what society looks like belongs to all people together, equally. Democracy is very positive and important, but the way in which we designed the democracy we have now also has a lot of problems. These problems are not just an accident, but a result of the way in which we designed our system. We think that communalism is a different way of ‘doing democracy’ that could solve many of these problems.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The problems are numerous. For example, national politicians and the people who elect them often do not know each other very well. There is a large distance between them, and if the politician wants to be elected again it is important if their party gives them a high position on the voting ballot list. This means that the politician has a strong motivation to do well for the party, sometimes more so than for the people who elected them. Another example could be that many people do not always enjoy their job. They might be separated from coworkers, they might feel like a cog in a machine, they might feel like they do not share in the profits of the company, they might not agree with how some things are run or they might not like the policy and culture. These problems are very hard, or even impossible, to completely solve in the system we now live in.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Communalism, as the name implies, focuses on the community at the lower level. That lower level can be a town, city or even a neighborhood. It is an idea that says it would be good if small communities that know each other could govern themselves in all kinds of ways, rather than being run top-down by people far away. People can actively create structures to govern and work together and this can be a nicer way of living, in addition to solving many problems. This communal approach to things can be applied in many areas from government to energy supply in the neighborhood and from companies to the designing of the city space. Maybe not everybody wants to replace everything with communal structures, and some do want that. And maybe people think differently on how communal structures should be designed. But broadly, we can agree on moving in a direction where we implement many communal ideas, and we do not need to have all the answers yet from the start.</p>

      <h1>Practice</h1>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">How does communalism look in practice? An example could be that neighborhoods can hold meetings together. There, everybody has a voice and people can collectively decide what to do with the neighborhood or how the neighborhood thinks the city should be run. Maybe people can even come to an agreement or compromise without voting. The neighborhood can then together with other neighborhoods decide how the city should be run, for example by appointing some representatives. This process can continue all the way up. Another example could be that in companies, not shareholders from outside but the employees themselves own the business together. They can all together have meetings and share their insights on how the company should be run. This way people can feel part of the project together, share in the profits and hear everyone’s voice in internal company matters.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">There are many ways to try and make sure these proposals can happen. We can talk about it, do activism, vote for candidates who support the ideas, and much more. In real life, we probably cannot do everything at once. So for example, maybe we can start by giving some neighborhoods money that they can use how they want to themselves in a way to make the living space nicer. Another example could be that we could help getting companies started where employees own the place together, or maybe we can try and make sure that in existing companies employees already get to own a large piece of the company and are involved in decision making. That way, we can get to a more communal society even if we cannot change everything immediately in a complete way.</p>
      
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We hope we can create a more communalist society together. Do you want to know more, or even help us? Then be sure to read our complete manifesto!</h5>
